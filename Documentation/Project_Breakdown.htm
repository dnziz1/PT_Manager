<br />
CODING - The app will be written mainly using Java programming language and will be adapted to run on mobile phones using Android Studio.
<br />DATABASE - MySQL has been chosen as the backend database which can normally be connected to using the JDBC API/driver in Java.
<br /><span class="tab">	For this project the MySQL database will reside on a localhost server. In the real world, the database would reside on a remote server.
<br />	We will use the Rest api to connect to the database from Android Studio
<br /></span></p>
