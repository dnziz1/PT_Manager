<h2>PERSONAL TRAINER STORIES</h2>
<p>(Roles: Developer: Kevin Hills, Personal Trainers: Team members
<br /></p>
<h3>1.	As a trainer I wish to login to my account so that I can view my calendar and see my classes for any day</h3>
<p><span class="tab">Developer: How do you wish to login?
<br />Trainer: Enter my own username and password into a screen
<br /><br />Developer: What happens after entering the correct login details?
<br />Trainer: The current day’s calendar is displayed clearly showing my classes for the day
<br /><br />Developer: How many times is the user allowed to enter an incorrect password.
<br />Trainer: 3
<br /><br />Developer: What happens after 3 failed attempts?
<br />Trainer: Account is locked for a temporary period
<br /><br />Developer: What is an acceptable amount of time to be "locked out"?
<br />Trainer: 5 minutes
<br /><br />Developer: What happens if the password has been forgotten?
<br />Trainer: Click a "Forgot Password" button to reset it
<br /><br />Developer: After clicking the "Forgot Password" button what should happen?
<br />Trainer: An email is sent which contains a link to a screen that allows the password to be changed
<br /><br />Developer thoughts and team discussions: 
<br /><span class="tab">Username constraints: 6 to 30 characters seems to be the accepted standard. Will consist of a combination of alphabetic and numeric characters.
<br />Password constraints: The standard minimum length is usually 8 characters with a maximum length of at least 64 characters.
Password to consist of at least one special character, plus at least one uppercase character plus at least one numerical character. 
The constraints must be shown on screen to assist the user.
Perhaps as a future enhancement - add two factor authentication ie verify the user by sending an authorisation prompt to their mobile phone.
Need to store user information including their usernames and especially passwords securely. The user information must include their role to be able to determine which features they can access. A list will be required detailing which roles are authorised to access a particular feature.
Need a login for system administrators to use and an option to enable them to add a new user or amend/remove an existing user so that staff are not required to go into the backend database.
